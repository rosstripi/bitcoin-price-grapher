bitcoin-price-grapher
=====================

Pulls values of bitcoin from bitcoinprice twitter account and plots them.

Dependencies:
python-twitter, matplotlib

Until I can figure out how to make this work without them, you need to create consumer, consumer secret, access, and access secret tokens at https://dev.twitter.com/ and insert them into the relevant variables in the source file.
