bitcoin-price-grapher
=====================

Pulls values of bitcoin from bitcoinprice twitter account and plots them.

Dependencies:
python-twitter, matplotlib

Until I can figure out how to make this work without them, you need to create consumer, consumer secret, access, and access secret tokens and insert them into the relevant variables in the source file.
